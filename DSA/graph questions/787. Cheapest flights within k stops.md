> This is an basic dijkstra's question without using priority queue... since we are considering k stops... we can only need to visit k levels but there are multiple nodes connection to one node thus we need to process these in levels and thus use BFS... thus we are using level order traversal here

```cpp
typedef pair<int, int> pi;

class Solution {
public:
    int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<pi>> adj;
        vector<int> result(n, INT_MAX);

        for(auto &x: flights){
            int u = x[0];
            int v = x[1];
            int w = x[2];

            adj[u].push_back({v, w});
        }

        queue<pi> que;
        que.push({0, src});
        result[src] = 0;

        int level = 0;

        while(!que.empty() && level <= k){
            int levelSize = que.size();

            for(int i=0; i<levelSize; i++){
                int weight = que.front().first;
                int node = que.front().second;
                que.pop();

                for(auto neighbour: adj[node]){
                    int currNode = neighbour.first;
                    int currWeight = neighbour.second;

                    if (currWeight + weight < result[currNode]){
                        result[currNode] = currWeight + weight;
                        que.push({currWeight + weight, currNode});
                    }
                }
            }

            level++;
        }

        return result[dst] == INT_MAX ? -1 : result[dst];
        
    }
};

```


### Why do we need queue .... why PQ wont work?
In this implementation, a `queue<pi>` is being used to perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversal of the graph. The purpose of the queue is to explore the nodes level by level, keeping track of the accumulated weight from the source to each node.

Using a `priority_queue` might not be appropriate for this specific problem because BFS ensures that you visit all nodes at a particular level before moving on to the next level. A priority queue, on the other hand, would prioritize nodes based on their weights, and it might not guarantee that you explore all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level.

In other words, BFS explores nodes level by level, and using a regular queue helps in ensuring that nodes at the same level are processed before moving to the next level. If you use a priority queue, it may not preserve this level-wise exploration order.
