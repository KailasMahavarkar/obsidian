8086 -> emulator The Intel 8088, released July 1, 1979 is a slightly modified chip with an external 8-bit data bus

# Buses and operation

All internal registers, as well as internal and external data buses, are 16 bits wide, which firmly established the "16-bit microprocessor" identity of the 8086.

A 20-bit external address bus provides a 1 [MiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte "Mebibyte") physical address space (220 = 1,048,576 x 1 [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte")).

This address space is addressed by means of internal memory "segmentation".

The data bus is [multiplexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexed "Multiplexed") with the address bus in order to fit all of the control lines into a standard 40-pin [dual in-line package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_in-line_package "Dual in-line package")
