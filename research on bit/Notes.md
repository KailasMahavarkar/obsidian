When you are planning the CSS architecture for your design system:

- Reduce issues with inheritance and specificity.
- Use fewer styling rules for more efficient CSS and reusability.
- Make it long-term maintainable, and scale it up over time.
- It should be accessible and device-independent.
- All developers should be able to use it because it is well documented.
- Define coding styles, organization, and naming conventions.
