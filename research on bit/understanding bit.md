## Why bit exists?
1. Git is version control system and github/bitbucket is source code repository (git is opensource, github is not)
2. Bit is version control system to manage small to large components (Bit is a distributed version control system for components and their dependencies) in laymen terms using Bit we can version components.

## similarities between bit and lerna ??
1) both are monorepo solutions
2) both has unique way of tackling problem related to managing multiple packages

## Things to know about bit
1. each component in bit can be as large as entire application or smaller like a base button
2. bit supports multiple frameworks, thus we can write logic in terms of node and for UI we can use react/vue/angular etc


## What advantages does bit offer?
1) modularity - as a component library all @oxygen/core components should be separated out such that it does not depend on each other tightly
2) unlike lerna we don't use concept of monorepo instead in bit we play in modular components
