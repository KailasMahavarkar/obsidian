Just like storybook where each component is displayed with all props bit has similar way of displaying each composition but with limitations.

Limitation:
1) editing props and custom property directly in browser preview is not possible in bit like it can be done in storybook

Advantages:
1) each custom component code is directly available in browser itself

> My perspective:
> We can use storybook separately and use bit for managing components since in terms of documentation storybook treats it as first class citizen while bit mainly focuses on managing components
