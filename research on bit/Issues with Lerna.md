Here nrwl(company who owns NX) has mentioned:

Lerna has definitely pioneered the JS monorepo space, however, the tooling space has progressed a lot in recent years. Some of its features are now baked into NPM, YARN, PNPM, and Lerna [lacks many other important monorepo features](https://monorepo.tools/#tools-review) such as **computation caching** to mention one example.
