Physical Layer (Layer 1)

The Physical Layer is the first and lowest layer in the OSI model. It deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium.

#### **Functions:**

1. Bit Transmission
2. Data Encoding
3. Data Rate (Bandwidth)
4. Synchronization
5. Transmission Mode
6. Topology and Physical Network Layout, Physical Network Devices

Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
The Data Link Layer is the second layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the Physical Layer. 
The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers: **Logical Link Control (LLC)** and **Media Access Control (MAC).**
