to add skin we use OPR panel
cwopr campaigns and click add button
we have configurations options we can use to choose where to display skin, which page etc

we disable ads when we apply skinning,
for testing purpose we can use adblock

few things to configure when we want to take skin to homepage
1) banner(wallpaper)
2) css 
3) PQ banner

static skin (mostly ES team manages it) but agar model page pe koi skin jaa rha h tab hume widget banana padta h

In dynamic skin we make custom widgets
1. we make own wallpaper
