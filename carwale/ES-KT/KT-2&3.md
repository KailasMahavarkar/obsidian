Design Team handles most of Leaderboard(banner) if it is animated.

UI team interacts with design team if there
are JS related logic which cannot be implemented with GWD.

First course of action in this case is to use available templates within GWD which was made by design team and re-use it <u>if possible</u>

Now even if the animation is not possible in GWD and requires JS (like countdown ticker then we have to manually create such logic in html)

only frequent and indemand client templates are added as template in GWD.
