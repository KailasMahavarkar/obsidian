The primary purpose of using the Babel plugin to transform template literals is indeed to ensure browser compatibility. Template literals were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), and while they are supported in modern browsers and most JavaScript environments, they may not be supported in older environments or versions of JavaScript.

By transforming template literals, the plugin allows developers to write code using template literals without worrying about compatibility issues. The transformed code ensures that the functionality provided by template literals is available in a wider range of browsers and JavaScript environments.

Additionally, the plugin can optimize the performance of template literals in certain cases. By transforming the way template literals are handled, such as using `concat()` instead of string concatenation, the plugin can improve the efficiency and execution speed of the code.

In summary, the main reasons for using the Babel plugin to transform template literals are:

1. Browser compatibility: It ensures that code using template literals can run in older browsers or JavaScript environments that may not natively support them.

2. Performance optimization: The plugin can transform the code to improve performance and execution speed in certain scenarios.

By leveraging the Babel plugin, developers can write code using modern JavaScript features, such as template literals, while ensuring compatibility and optimizing performance across different environments.


TLDR;
The Babel plugin transforms template literals for compatibility and performance, allowing code using template literals to run in older environments and optimizing execution speed.
